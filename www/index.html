  <div id="post-content" class="collapse post-body">This is unplanned it really just happens. It is a lot of fun. This is
    the way you take out your flustrations. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. This is your world.
    Every day I learn. Let's build an almighty mountain. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Anything
    you want to do you can do here. Imagination is the key to painting. Let's have a nice tree right here. Don't fight it,
    use what happens. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Maybe there
    was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the
    river and drowned. It's important to me that you're happy. Let all these things just sort of happen. There are no mistakes.
    You can fix anything that happens. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Trees cover up a multitude
    of sins. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. We
    don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Each highlight must have
    it's own private shadow. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Let's make a nice big leafy
    tree. Just make little strokes like that. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have
    nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Only think about one thing at a time.
    Don't get greedy. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do
    strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very
    important. Fluff that up.
